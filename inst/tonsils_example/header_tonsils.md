[`iSEE`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE) delivers a fully interactive browser for the specific single cell dataset it refers to - in this case, the ones contained in the [`HCATonsilData`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/HCATonsilData) package.

Every app starts with a configuration that mirrors the findings presented in the original publication, "[An Atlas of Cells in the Human Tonsil](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.24.497299v1)", by Massoni-Badosa et al., doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.24.497299.

In each instance, you can follow a tour that guides you through the main findings as they are presented. At any time, you are free to change any of the defined settings to explore in depth the dataset.
